# Problem 52:
#     Permuted Multiples
#
# Description:
#     It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748,
#       contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.
#
#     Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

    # Idea:
    #     Consider the desired number `x` based on its `n` digits.
    #
    #     FACTS:
    #       * x = _ ... _ (n digits)
    #       * 10^(n-1) <= x < 10^n
    #
    #       * All multiples (x, ..., 6x) must have the same number of digits,
    #           since they must be permutations of each other.
    #
    #       * x < 10^n / 6,
    #           else 6*x >= 10^n, and so 6*x would have more than n digits.
    #
    #       * First digit of x must be 1
    #
    #       * Must have n >= 6
    #           => Already know from previous fact that x = 1 _ ... _,
    #                and each multiple will differ from the previous by x,
    #                so each next multiple will start with a new greater digit,
    #                thus x must have at least 6 distinct digits
